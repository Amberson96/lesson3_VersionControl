## Lessons Learned in the Assignment
1.) Version Control gives you the opportunity to easily have backup files accessible just in case you delete or wipe out a file completely.

2.) There are three states in Git: Commited, Modified, and Staged. These help with storing data, modifying it, and putting it into the next commit snapshot.

3.) Modifying files is easy to accidently do and not even realize it. Git add and Git status help us figure out if a file has been modified from its original state. This helps us keep up to date with what is going on in our files without reading through the entire data.
